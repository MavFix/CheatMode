# Cheat Mode

Cheat Mode is a mod that gives players an easy way to access the creative inventory from the survival mode,
as well as some nice options. Since versions 2.0.0+ these can be changed in the **chat screen**.

Opening the creative inventory in survival mode only works on servers where the player has **gamemode permissions**.
